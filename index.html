                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone! 大家好! My name is Tyla Tipton. 我的中文名字是唐诗逸。I am from Greenville, SC in the upstate and go to school at the University of South Carolina in Columbia! I am majoring in Global Studies with a double minor in Chinese Studies and Applied Computing. I have been studying Mandarin as a second language for two years now, though I am still quite a beginner and do not have much experience speaking in the real world. </p>
                    <p class="hidden1" id="about-me">My major area of study is of the global relations and studies, Chinese language and culture, international politics, and human rights. Recently, however, I have been into the world of web development, design, and coding. As a rising Junior, I did not want to take up the Computer Science minor because I didn’t want to prolong my graduation which is where I found out about the Applied Computing minor! I am having a great time so far learning about web development and love the thought and creativity that goes into building websites.
                    Other than academics, some other interests of mine include dancing, listening to music, reading, watching TV and movies, and hanging out with friends. </p>

				<h3>My Future Career Plans</h3>
                    <p>For my future career plans, I would like to get a job relevant to web development, design, and perhaps integrate in my knowledge and passion for Chinese. As a child, I was always creative and loved to draw and paint. However, as I grew, I strayed away from art since I had a belief that it was not lucrative enough. However, with the rise of computing and the internet, there is a market for website development and design. Furthermore, I am learning that coding and web development is more creative than I initially thought!</p>
                    <p class="hidden2" id="future-plans">Along with this, I would love to continue my study of Mandarin. Since I am still a beginner and do not have much real world experience, I still have a long way to go, but I would love to continue my study. In my job, it would be good to incorporate these skills whether I am around coworkers or clients who speak Mandarin or I am building designs and websites around topics of Chinese culture or language. </p>
